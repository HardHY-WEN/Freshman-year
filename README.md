# Freshman-year
Projects learned and created during the freshman year


//Studyed Experience
I started by self-studying C language, then moved on to learning the 51 single-chip microcomputer and the standard library of STM32F1 single-chip microcomputer. After that, I embarked on a simple project - the STM32 balancing car. Through this project, I not only became more familiar with the standard library of STM32F1 but also learned to draw circuit boards with PCB and solder various components. At the same time, I also learned about various sensors. This project brought me a lot of gains. Then, I learned the HAL library of STM32F1 and participated in the Rino DVD all-terrain car competition, where I gained some competition experience and learned some technologies, such as wireless remote control of the car and controlling the car to go up and down slopes (controlling the lifting of the front and rear wheels), etc. This also greatly boosted my confidence. Subsequently, I learned the FreeRTOS operating system, laying some foundations for my future learning. The learning in my freshman year was unprecedentedly challenging, but I did not give up. I will continue to move forward and strive to improve my skills.
